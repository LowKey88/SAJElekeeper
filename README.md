# Home Assistant SAJ Elekeeper Custom Integration

A Home Assistant custom component for monitoring SAJ solar inverters and battery systems through the SAJ Elekeeper platform. This integration fetches data from the SAJ cloud API and presents it as sensors within Home Assistant.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=lowkey88&repository=SAJElekeeper&category=integration)

## Features

- Monitor SAJ solar inverters and battery systems
- View real-time power generation, grid status, and battery information
- Track daily and total energy production
- Monitor home load power and self-consumption
- Support for both solar inverters and battery systems
- Automatic detection of nighttime mode for solar inverters
- Environmental impact statistics (CO2 reduction, equivalent trees)

## Prerequisites

Before installing this integration, you need to obtain SAJ Developer API credentials and device information:

### 1. Getting API Credentials

1. **Register as a Developer on the SAJ Elekeeper Platform:**
   - Log in to the [Elekeeper web portal](https://intl-developer.saj-electric.com)
   - Find the developers function on the top of the portal
   - Choose "Autonomous Account"
   - Complete the developer registration form
   - Wait for SAJ to process your application

2. **Obtain Your API Credentials:**
   - After approval, navigate to the developer console
   - Go to "App Configuration" in the settings menu
   - You'll receive:
     - App ID
     - App Secret
   - Keep these credentials handy for the integration setup

3. **Authorize Resources:**
   - Set up which plants/devices you want to monitor
   - Follow the authorization process in the developer section

### 2. Getting Device Information

You'll need the following information about your devices:
   - **Device Serial Number (SN)**: This can be found in the Elekeeper console under "View Authorized Devices"
   - **Plant ID**: This is associated with your plant in the Elekeeper platform
   - **Device Type**: Select whether the device is a solar inverter or battery system

For detailed instructions on this process, refer to the SAJ Elekeeper API Documentation at the [SAJ International Developer Portal](https://intl-developer.saj-electric.com). The portal provides:

- API documentation
- Developer guides 
- Sample code
- File center with additional resources at https://intl-developer.saj-electric.com/fileCenter/index

If you are a plant owner and working with a third-party developer, you'll need to authorize their developer ID to access your plant data.

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Make sure [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) is installed in your Home Assistant instance.
2. Click the HACS install button above or add this repository as a custom repository in HACS:
   - Go to HACS > Integrations > â‹® > Custom repositories
   - Add `https://github.com/lowkey88/SAJElekeeper` as a repository
   - Select "Integration" as the category
3. Click "Download" on the SAJ Elekeeper integration
4. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from this repository
2. Create a `custom_components` directory in your Home Assistant configuration directory if it doesn't already exist
3. Extract the `saj_elekeeper` directory from the release into the `custom_components` directory
4. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

After installation, you'll need to configure the integration:

1. Go to Home Assistant > Settings > Devices & Services
2. Click "Add Integration" and search for "SAJ Elekeeper"
3. You'll be prompted to enter your API credentials:
   - **App ID**: Enter the App ID obtained from the Elekeeper developer portal
   - **App Secret**: Enter the App Secret obtained from the Elekeeper developer portal
4. Click "Submit" to validate your credentials
5. Next, you'll be prompted to add your device:
   - **Name**: Enter a friendly name for your device (e.g., "Rooftop Solar")
   - **SN**: Enter the device Serial Number from the Elekeeper console
   - **Plant ID**: Enter the Plant ID from the Elekeeper console
   - **Type**: Select either "solar" or "battery" depending on your device type
6. Click "Submit" to add the device
7. You can add additional devices by repeating the process

After adding your devices, the integration will create entities for each device, and you can start monitoring your SAJ solar inverters and battery systems in Home Assistant.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the Home Assistant logs for error messages
2. Make sure your SAJ Developer API credentials are correct
3. Verify that your device serial numbers and plant IDs are correct
4. Confirm that you've completed the authorization process on the SAJ Elekeeper platform
5. Ensure your developer account has permissions to access the devices you're trying to monitor
6. Restart Home Assistant after making changes to the integration

If you receive authentication errors, you may need to:
- Check if your developer account is still active
- Re-authorize your resources in the Elekeeper portal
- Verify you're using the international node: https://intl-developer.saj-electric.com (for international users except Europe)
- European users should use: https://developer.electric.com
