# SAJ Monitor - Home Assistant Integration

A Home Assistant custom component for monitoring SAJ solar inverters and battery systems. This integration fetches data from the SAJ cloud API and presents it as sensors within Home Assistant.

## Features

- Monitor SAJ solar inverters and battery systems
- View real-time power generation, grid status, and battery information
- Track daily and total energy production
- Monitor home load power and self-consumption
