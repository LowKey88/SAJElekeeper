# SAJ Monitor - Home Assistant Integration

A Home Assistant custom component for monitoring SAJ solar inverters and battery systems. This integration fetches data from the SAJ cloud API and presents it as sensors within Home Assistant.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=lowkey88&repository=SAJMonitor&category=integration)

## Features

- Monitor SAJ solar inverters and battery systems
- View real-time power generation, grid status, and battery information
- Track daily and total energy production
- Monitor home load power and self-consumption
- Support for both solar inverters and battery systems
- Automatic detection of nighttime mode for solar inverters
- Environmental impact statistics (CO2 reduction, equivalent trees)
